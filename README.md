# Asterisk Ansible Playbook

## Description

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbook for automatic installation of [Asterisk PBX](https://www.asterisk.org/) on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
I use Asterisk LTS (v18) and Ubuntu Server LTS (v22.04), but I'm pretty sure it's possible to install another version of Asterisk with little to no changes using this playbook.

## Usage

To install Asterisk on your Ubuntu server using this playbook, you need to:

- install Ansible (`brew install ansible` on macOS, `apt install ansible` on Ubuntu. Please check docs if you're using Windows â€” or just install Ansible into WSL)
- update variables (Asterisk version, number of CPU cores) in `playbook.yaml` if you need it
- add the IP addresses of your servers to `inventory.yaml`
- run playbook this way: `ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -i inventory.yaml`
